The final model we are submitting is a 16.9 MB convLSTM2D layer based model.
This model got a validation accuracy of 70%.
It's also quite small in size and therefore fast to classify images in a small web camera.

It needs inputs in 120x120 pixel size, and it will take one frame out of every 3 for doing classification.
